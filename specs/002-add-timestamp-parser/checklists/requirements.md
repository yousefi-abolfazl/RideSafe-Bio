# Specification Quality Checklist: Add Timestamp Parser (clock-time → seconds)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass 1 (2026-09-19): all items pass; no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were
  needed — scope (timestamp→seconds only), rollover policy (refuse > 60 s backwards), and
  tie handling (keep both rows, report count) were resolved with documented defaults in
  the spec's Edge Cases and Assumptions sections.
- Uniform resampling / gap splitting are explicitly out of scope (Assumptions); they are
  candidates for a follow-up specification.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
